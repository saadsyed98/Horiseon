# Horiseon Assignment
Module 1 Assignment
In this assignment we were given a mock up and some base code and were told to fix the websites landing page.
Our goal was to update the code and make the website function better than before. 
These were the exact criteria:
WHEN I view the source code,
THEN I find semantic HTML elements.
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements,
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
WHEN I view the image elements,
THEN I find accessible alt attributes.
WHEN I view the heading attributes,
THEN they fall in sequential order.
WHEN I view the title element,
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title.
When we were finished, this is what our page looked like
